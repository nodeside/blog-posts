Often when using nodejs you might want to quickly see who is using a port and get some basic information about the process.

To get the process PID
<div class="gist-loader" id="ellman/8581469"></div>

To get additional info based on the PID
<div class="gist-loader" id="ellman/8581561"></div>

<pre>
whatis <process> # Gives you process description
whereis <process> # Gives you source usuall something like /usr/local/bin/<process>
</pre>
